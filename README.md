## 🧠 Core Logic

Transactions are stored as an array of objects like this:

```js
{
  id: 1698349144921,
  description: "Pago mamá",
  amount: 1000,
  type: "Expense"
}
Actions Supported:
addTransaction() → Validates form, stores new data

editTransaction(id) → Replaces existing object with edits

deleteTransaction(id) → Filters out by ID

updateSummary() → Recalculates income, expense, and balance

Data saved to and loaded from localStorage
